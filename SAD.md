## Introduction to ASPICE

**ASPICE (Automotive SPICE)** is a framework for assessing and improving software development processes in the automotive industry. It's based on ISO/IEC 15504 (SPICE) and specifically tailored for automotive software development.

ASPICE defines process reference models that cover the entire software development lifecycle, including requirements engineering, software design, implementation, integration, and testing.

## Software Architecture Design (SAD)

### Definition
Software Architecture Design is the high-level design phase that defines the overall structure and organization of the software system. It focuses on the fundamental organization of a system embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and to the environment.

- Defines design patterns for common problems
- Establishes architectural constraints and guidelines

#### 3. **Interface Definition**
